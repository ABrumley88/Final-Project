Explorations in Sound
A sound box that when approached produces a sound based on distance.
Summary
Using ultra-sonic sensors, sounds/music notes will be mapped to set distances. When you approach the machine these sounds are triggered via wav shield.
Component Parts
analog distance sensor

Laptop
Usb Cable
Arduino Uno
Breadboard
Jumper Cables
(external: speakers)
Challenges
Mapping of sounds, as well as creating a sound library in which sounds work together to produce polyphonic harmony. Starting with one sensor, but would like to add up to 3 total.
Timeline
What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!
•	Week 1: Write proposal
•	Week 2: Build Sound Library
•	Week 3: Work on Code/ work out kinks
•	Week 4: Build Enclosure
•	Week 5: Present!
